# Learning Objectives

In this lecture, we will

- Continue our discussion of numerical and visual summaries of data

    - We discuss contingency tables and bar plots for summarizing categorical data. Textbook section 2.2.1. 
    - We see how to use R to compute numerical summaries and visualizations for categorical data.

# A Note on Categorical Variables in R

- Often, a categorical variable is called a **factor**, and each category is called a **level**. 

--

- For example, consider letter grades such as we assign at the University. This is a factor with 11 levels: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, and F.  

--

- Note that here we know all of the possible outcomes (levels) *a priori*. 


---

# Creating a Factor in R

Here is an example of creating a factor in R:

```{r}
my_grades <- factor(
  c(rep("A",4),rep("B",6),rep("B-",4),rep("C",8),rep("C-",2),
                      rep("D",2),rep("F",3)),
                    levels=c("A","A-","B+","B","B-","C+","C","C-","D+","D","F")
  )
```

---

# Recall the `table` Function 

```{r}
table(my_grades)
```

--

- The `table` function returns the count of how many times each level of a factor appears in the data. This is sometimes called a frequency table. 

--

- A table such as the one we just obtained is a typical way to summarize a single categorical variable. 

---

# Bar Plots

A barplot is the visual analog of a frequency table. 

```{r,fig.height=4}
grades_df <- tibble(my_grades=my_grades)
gf_bar(~my_grades,data=grades_df)
```

---

# Summarizing Data for Two Categorical Variables

Scatterplots provide a way to summarize together two numerical variables, methods for summarizing together two categorical variables include:

--

- Contingency tables 

--

- Proportion tables

--

- Stacked or side-by-side bar plots

--

- Mosaic plots

--

We will explain each of these tools and illustrate how to obtain them in R. We will work with the `loans_dat` data set. This data set represents thousands of loans made through the Lending Club platform, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals. 


---

# Contingency Tables

Contingency tables display the number of times a particular combination of variable outcomes occurs. 

--

- For example, we construct a contingency table for the variables `homeownership` (ownership status of the applicant's residence) and `application_type` (type of application: either individual or joint):

--

```{r}
with(loans_dat,addmargins(table(application_type,homeownership)))
```

--

- If we create a barplot for `homeownership`, we will see bars corresponding to the first three values in the last row of our table. Similarly, a barplot for `application_type` will show bars corresponding to the first two values in the last column of our table. 

---

# Bar Plots for `loans_dat`

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
p1 <- gf_bar(~homeownership,data=loans_dat)
p2 <- gf_bar(~application_type,data=loans_dat)
p1 + p2
with(loans_dat,addmargins(table(application_type,homeownership)))
```

---

# Proportion Tables

At times, it is useful to compute proportions instead of counts. 

--

- A proportion table displays the same essential information as a contingency table except we divide entries by either the row sums (row proportion table) or the column sum (column proportion table). 

--

- For example, if we divide each entry in the first row of the previous table by 8505, and divide each entry in the second row by 1495, we obtain
```{r}
(c(3839,1170,3496) / 8505)
(c(950, 183, 362) / 1495)
```

--

- This gives us our values for a row proportion table. 

---

# Proportion Tables Example

- Row proportion table

```{r}
with(loans_dat,addmargins(prop.table(table(application_type,homeownership),
                                     margin=1)))
```

--

- Column proportion table


```{r}
with(loans_dat,addmargins(prop.table(table(application_type,homeownership),
                                     margin=2)))
```


---

# Stacked and Side-By-Side Barplots

```{r,fig.width=11,fig.height=5}
p1 <- gf_bar(~homeownership,data=loans_dat,fill=~application_type) + 
  ggtitle("Stacked")
p2 <- gf_bar(~homeownership,data=loans_dat,fill=~application_type,
             position = position_dodge()) + ggtitle("Side-By-Side")
p1 + p2
```


---

# Standardized Stacked Bar Plot

Stacked bar plots can be used to contruct a visualization of a proportion table. 

--

- For example, the following stacked bar plot displays our column proportion table as a plot:

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.height=3}
stack_bar_dat %>% ggplot(aes(x=homeownership,y=n,fill=application_type)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```


```{r,echo=FALSE}
with(loans_dat,addmargins(prop.table(table(application_type,homeownership),
                                     margin=2)))
```


---

# Mosaic Plots

A **mosiac plot** is a visualization that corresponds to contingency tables. They can be one-variable of multi-variable.

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.height=5,fig.width=11}
p1 <- loans_dat %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_mosaic(aes(x=product(homeownership),fill=homeownership)) + theme(legend.position = "none",axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y=element_blank())
p2 <- loans_dat %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_mosaic(aes(x=product(application_type,homeownership),fill=homeownership)) + theme(legend.position = "none")
p3 <- loans_dat %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_mosaic(aes(x=product(homeownership,application_type),fill=homeownership)) + theme(legend.position = "none")
p1 + p2 + p3 
```


---

# Grouped Numerical Data

- Grouped numerical data arises when we want to study the distribution of a numerical variable across two or more distinguishing groups. 

--

- In other words, we are looking for association between two variables where one variable is numerical (typically viewed as the response variable) and the other is categorical (typically viewed as the explanatory variable). 

--

- For example, consider out `possum` data set again.

```{r}
head(possum,5)
```

--

- We could ask, is there a difference in the distribution of possum tail length between female and male possums?  

---

# Grouped Summaries

We can compute grouped numerical summaries:

```{r}
possum %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(mean_tail_l=mean(tail_l),
                                        median_tail_l=median(tail_l),
                                        tail_l_var=var(tail_l),
                                        sd_tail_l=sd(tail_l))
```

---

# Grouped plots

We can also create grouped plots:

```{r,fig.height=5,fig.width=11}
p1 <- gf_boxplot(tail_l~sex,data=possum,color=~sex,binwidth=2)
p2 <- gf_histogram(~tail_l | sex,data=possum,fill=~sex,binwidth=2)
p1 + p2
```

---

# R Tips: the Tidyverse

In order to work with data, compute summaries, and obtain visualizations, we are employing the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) family of R packages. This includes 

- `dplyr` for working with and summarizing data

- `ggplot2` for graphics and visualizations 

- `readr` for reading data into R

- etc. 

--

- The tidyverse utilizes the principle of **tidy** data for facilitating analyses.
