# Linear Regression: Introduction 

- Linear regression is the statistical method for fitting a line to data. 

--

- Recall that a (non-vertical) line in the $x,y$-plane is determined by 

$$y = \text{slope} \times x + \text{intercept}$$

--

- There are two aspects to fitting a line to data;

--

  - Estimating the slope and intercept values, and
  
--

  - Assessing the uncertainty of our estimates for the slope and intercept values.
 
--

- In this lecture, we cover all of the concepts necessary to understand how to carry out and interpret linear regression. 
  
--

- We encourage you to watch the video on the next slide to help in getting introduced to linear regression.

# Learning Objectives

- After this lecture, you should

--

  - Understand the basic principles of simple linear regression: parameter estimates, residuals, and correlation.
  
--

  - Know the conditions for least squares regression: linearity, normality, constant variance, and independence.
  
--

  - Know how to obtain a linear fit using  R with the `lm` function. 
  
--

  - Be able to assess and interpret the results of a linear fit using  R with the `lm` function.
