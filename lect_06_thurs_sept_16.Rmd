# Learning Objectives

In this lecture, we will

- Examine the most important concepts related to our study of random variables.

--

- Recall from the last lecture that we introduced the notion of a random variable, that is, something that assigns a numerical value to events from a random process.

--

- We typically denote random variables by capital letters at the end of the alphabet such as $X$, $Y$, or $Z$.

--

- Our primary goal is to study methods that allow us to better understand the distribution of a random variable.
